## Description
This document describes the format of the `chathistory` extension. This enables clients to request messages that were previously sent if they are still available on the server.

The server as mentioned in this document may refer to either an IRC server or an IRC bouncer.

## Implementation
The `chathistory` extension uses the [chathistory][batch/chathistory] batch type and introduces a client command, `chathistory`.

To fully support this extension, clients MUST support the [`batch`][batch], [`server-time`][server-time] and [`message-tags`][message-tags] capabilities.

The `chathistory` capability MUST be negotiated. This allows the server and client to act differently when delivering message history on connection.

An ISUPPORT token MUST be sent to the client to state the maximum number of messages a client can request in a single command, represented by an integer. `CHATHISTORY=50`. If `0`, the client SHOULD assume that there is no maximum number of messages.

The `event-playback` capability MAY be negotiated. This allows the client to signal that it is capable of receiving and correctly processing lines that would normally produce a local state change (such as `JOIN` or `MODE`) in its history batches.

### `CHATHISTORY` Command
`CHATHISTORY` content can be requested by the client by sending the `CHATHISTORY` command to the server. A `batch` MUST be returned by the server. If no content exists to return, an empty batch SHOULD be returned to avoid the client waiting for a reply and to indicate that no content is available.

The `chathistory` command uses the following general syntax structure:

    CHATHISTORY <subcommand> <target> <timestamp | msgid> <limit>

The `target` parameter specifies a single buffer (channel or nickname) from which history SHOULD be retrieved. Any `timestamp` values or parameters MUST be in the format of `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ`.

If a nickname is given as the `target` then the server SHOULD include history sent between both the current user and the target nickname as to give a full conversation. The server SHOULD attempt to include history involving other nicknames if either the current user or the target nickname has changed during the requested timeframe.

#### Subcommands

The following subcommands are used to describe how the server should return messages relative to the `timestamp` or `msgid` given.

#### `BEFORE`

    CHATHISTORY BEFORE <target> <timestamp=YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ | msgid=1234> <limit>

Request up to `limit` number of messages before and including the given `timestamp` or `msgid`. Only one timestamp or msgid MUST be given, not both.

#### `AFTER`
    CHATHISTORY AFTER <target> <timestamp=YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ | msgid=1234> <limit>
Request up to `limit` number of messages after and excluding the given `timestamp` or `msgid`. Only one timestamp or msgid MUST be given, not both.

#### `LATEST`
    CHATHISTORY LATEST <target> <* | timestamp=YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ | msgid=1234> <limit>
Request the most recent messages that have been sent after and excluding the given `timestamp` or `msgid`. If a `*` is given instead of a timestamp or msgid, the server MUST use the current time as a timestamp. The number of messages returned MUST be equal to or less than `limit`. If a `*` is not given, only one timestamp or msgid MUST be given, not both.

This is useful for retrieving the latest conversation when first joining a channel or opening a query buffer.

#### `AROUND`
    CHATHISTORY AROUND <target> <timestamp=YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ | msgid=1234> <limit>
Request a number of messages before and after the `timestamp` or `msgid` with the total number of returned messages not exceeding `limit`. The implementation may decide how many messages to include before and after the selected message. Only one timestamp or msgid MUST be given, not both.

This is useful for retrieving conversation context around a single message.

#### Returned message notes
The returned messages MUST be in ascending time order and the `server-time` tag SHOULD be the time at which the message was received by the IRC server. The `msgid` tag that identifies each individual message in a response MUST be the `msgid` tag as originally sent by the IRC server.

If the client has not negotiated the `event-playback` capability, the server MUST NOT send any lines other than `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE` in the reply batch. If the client has negotiated `event-playback`, the server SHOULD send additional lines relevant to the chat history, including but not limited to `TAGMSG`, `JOIN`, `PART`, `QUIT`, `MODE`, `TOPIC`, and `NICK`.

#### Errors and Warnings
Errors are returned using the standard replies syntax.

If the server receives a `CHATHISTORY` command with an unknown subcommand, the `UNKNOWN_COMMAND` error code MUST be returned.
> FAIL CHATHISTORY UNKNOWN_COMMAND the_given_command :Unknown command

If the server receives a `CHATHISTORY` command with missing parameters, the `NEED_MORE_PARAMS` error code MUST be returned.
> FAIL CHATHISTORY NEED_MORE_PARAMS the_given_command :Missing parameters

If no message history can be returned due to an error, the `MESSAGE_ERROR` error code SHOULD be returned.
> FAIL CHATHISTORY MESSAGE_ERROR the_given_command the_given_target [extra_context] :Messages could not be retrieved

### Examples

[s] :irc.host BATCH -ID

## Use Cases
The batch type and supporting command are useful for allowing an "infinite scroll" type capability within the client. A client will, upon scrolling to the top of the active window or a manual trigger, may request `chathistory` from the server and, after receiving returned content, append it to the top of the window. Users can repeat this historic scrolling to retrieve prior history until limitations are met (see below).

Upon joining a channel, a client may request the latest messages for the buffer so that the active conversation context may be retrieved.

## Security Considerations
Secure identification of users and clients MUST exist in order to ensure that users cannot obtain history they are not authorised to view. Use of account names, internal account identifiers, or certificate fingerprints SHOULD be strongly considered when matching content to users. If a client requests content for a target that they do not have permission for, eg. a channel they are banned from, an empty batch SHOULD be returned as if no content exists.

While an ISUPPORT token value of `0` may be used to indicate no message limit exists, servers SHOULD set and enforce a reasonable maximum and properly throttle `CHATHISTORY` commands to prevent abuse.
